      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">NeuroPath began as a passion project by a group of educators and neuroscientists who were frustrated by one‑size‑fits‑all education. We saw brilliant students disengage because the material wasn’t presented in a way they could connect with. Leveraging research into different learning modalities—visual, auditory and logical—we set out to build a tool that adapts to the learner rather than forcing learners to adapt to the tool.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">After months of prototyping and countless hours speaking with students, parents and teachers, NeuroPath’s personalized learning platform was born. Our early beta testers reported renewed confidence and curiosity as lessons began to make sense in a way they hadn’t experienced before.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Our mission is simple yet ambitious: unlock every student’s potential. We believe that when learning resonates with how your brain works, anything is possible. By combining cognitive science with engaging technology, we aim to make personalized education accessible to all.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a future where every classroom—whether physical or virtual—empowers learners with content tailored to their style. NeuroPath will be available across devices, languages and borders, ensuring that personalized learning isn’t a privilege but a right. Together with educators and families, we’re building a world where no student is left behind.</p>
